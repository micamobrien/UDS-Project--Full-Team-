# Final Project: Gentrification in Westlake and Surrounding Communities

### By Jinglan Lin, Pearl Liu, Mica O'Brien, and Omer Sohail

For our final project, our group was interested in exploring neighborhood change and displacement risk in the Westlake neighborhood of Los Angeles. Our group is connected to a community organizing effort around building a strong “ground game” for updating the Westlake Community Plan, which will take place early next year. We hope this data analysis project will help organizers share the significance with funders and leaders of what’s at stake for the Westlake Community, a low-income Brown community that is vulnerable to gentrification.
